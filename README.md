##  Features

- Upload spending data in `.csv` or `.xlsx` format  
-  Automatically calculates average spend  
- Accepts custom user input for context

- Built with Flask backend + React (Vite) frontend

##  How It Works

1. User uploads a CSV/XLSX file with a column named `Amount`
2. Optionally includes a message (e.g., “for a farewell party”)
3. Backend parses the file, calculates the average spend
4. A prompt is sent to the AI model to suggest a creative event
5. Response includes an event name, short description, and sample budget breakdown
